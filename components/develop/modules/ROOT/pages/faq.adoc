== Are transactions free on SKALE?

Transactions on SKALE Chain run in a cost-free way. This means there is gas on SKALE Chains just like on Ethereum, but it's powered by sFUEL (SKALE FUEL), a gas token which has no monetary value. In this way, executing transactions and state changes don't incur costs but require consuming gas in sFUEL, which is zero-cost. SKALE Chain gas provides a way to meter or limit transactions on the SKALE Chain to prevent malicious execution.

== Can files be stored on SKALE?

You bet! Storing files on the blockchain is possible within the SKALE Network. You can use SKALE to host your text, image, HTML, and other file formats through the https://www.npmjs.com/package/@skalenetwork/filestorage.js[filestorage.js npm package].

== Can SKALE be used for data privacy sensible dApps?

The SKALE Network is suitable for enterprise apps, where data privacy is a concern due to the Network's security. More on SKALE's security here:

https://skale.network/blog/the-best-approach-to-securing-decentralized-networks/[SKALE Blog: The Best Approach to Securing Decentralized Networks]

https://docs.skale.network/technology/consensus-spec[SKALE Docs: Consensus]

The SKALE Network is permissionless, and blockchain data is publicly accessible. However, using this type of environment in enterprise applications means that the enterprise apps put a stronger focus on security and privacy within their entire app and not just the blockchain parts. An excellent example of an enterprise app that requires both privacy and security is a health care app that's improving the way health care data is shared between systems, all while integrating with scaling solutions like SKALE.

== Do I need to run a node to deploy a dApp?

No. Validators run and maintain SKALE Nodes, providing distributed computing power to the Network. The Network enables dApp developers to access validator-operated nodes' compute power to run SKALE Chains. 

== Do you have any examples of how gaming dApps are using SKALE?

Yes. There are several case studies of game developers building on the SKALE Network. A few of these case studies address gaming dApps and include why they're using SKALE and the benefits they're seeing.

One case study is on a strategy game where players can build empires and battle with other players. The other is an Ethereum-based battle game that features collectible cards. The benefits they see are higher transaction throughput, zero to near-zero gas fees, and faster commit times. They're also able to deploy over to SKALE, either by migrating a single, smart contract at a time in a phased approach or making use of multiple sidechains, each tailored to a specific feature set.

== Is it possible to use ERC1404 with SKALE IMA?

For restricted tokens like ERC1404, you will still use the Interchain Messaging Agent (IMA) since the contracts are mirrored between Ethereum and the SKALE Network. You will have complete control over when those tokens can be transferred. This is made possible because, at the core, SKALE allows you to deploy any smart contract written in solidity. In this use case, you will be able to deploy your ERC1404 (or similar) token smart contract for managing your restricted tokens, and through Interchain Messaging Agent, have it linked to your ERC1404 smart contract that lives on Ethereum. On the SKALE side, you will see the token as a clone of what exists on Ethereum via the Interchain Messaging Feature.

== What are the benefits of using SKALE?

Faster commit times, greater throughput, and lower transaction costs are the primary benefits of using a SKALE Chain. The advantages of using the SKALE Network, in particular, include a robust security model (based on random selection and frequent rotation of validator nodes), virtualized and containerized validator nodes, variable chain sizes, expandable on-chain storage options, BLS rollups, full EVM, and Web3 compatibility, and more.

You can visit the SKALE Network: https://skale.space/highlights[Technical Highlights] for a deeper dive into the benefits of the Network, including:

* Zero Gas Fees
* Random Node Rotation
* Containerized Validator Nodes
* Virtualized Subnodes
* Consensus via Asynchronous Binary Byzantine Agreement (ABBA)
* Node Monitoring
* Ethereum Interoperability

== What's the SKALE Innovator Program?

The SKALE Innovator Program is a program SKALE has been running for the last years. The program is for projects which plan to use SKALE chains. The incentives we offer projects (that's, access to engineering resources, introductions to SKALE investors, co-marketing, and a grant for using SKALE) are provided in exchange for feedback on the platform. We want to ensure that the SKALE team is building the right tools and systems for developers and partners and through the SKALE Innovator Program.

== How easy is it for EVM compatible codebase?

The SKALE execution model is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), making it so that smart contracts that run on the Ethereum mainnet can also run on the SKALE Network. There is no need to rewrite or port smart contracts. Anything written for the EVM will execute on the SKALE Network. As such, developers can migrate to SKALE Chains in a phased manner â€“ moving smart contracts to SKALE on an individual basis as the needs and benefits dictate.

Because the SKALE Network uses the Ethereum EVM, it also has full Solidity support and works with most of the Ethereum developer toolset. These include connecting to the Network via web3.js, ethers.js, and web3.py and supporting tools such as Truffle, Hardhat, and Remix. The SKALE Network supports all major Ethereum token standards, including ETH, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, USDC, Dai, USDT. 

In addition, the SKALE Network supports many popular https://docs.skale.network/develop/wallets[crypto wallets], browser plugins, and bridges. These include Bitski, Fortmatic, Metamask, Portis, Torus, Particle. These interface components are well-regarded in the community and used by thousands of developers. Lastly, the SKALE Network is easy to use. The steps to provision one or more SKALE chains are simple, with options to select sidechain size (small, medium, large), chain duration, storage options, and more.
